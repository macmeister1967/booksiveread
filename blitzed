BLITZED by Norman Ohler

2016 (2017) Creamy Penguin. Paperback.

This is a hugely enjoyable book that shows that among their better
known evils, the Nazi Germans were drug addicts whose Blitzkreig
tactics were built on methamphetamines. Super-aware soldiers needed
just a few hours of sleep a week and were able to run roughshod over
Europe in a matter of days.

I've got a friend I'll call Jampon who takes (barely legal)
amphetamines; probably as part of an ADHD diagnosis. He can take two
or three times, the main one is "Dexamphetamine" or Dex for short. The
Scottish band Dexy's Midnight Runners are named after the same Dex.

Jampon combines his Dex with large amounts of alcohol (previously
beer, nowadays red wine) which has little affect on his wakefulness
but doesn't improve his mood. His Nazi-era counterpart is Ernst
Udet. A World War 1 Flying Ace, Udet's addiction to amphetamines
(Pervitin) and alcohol makes him a woeful manager in World War
2. Ohler suggests he got his position because Goring only appointed
people who would drink red wine with him in the evenings.

Ohler writes (translated by Shaun Whiteside):
  Udet was very popular as the most successful
surviving fighter pilot of any nation in the First World
War. But this exceptionally gifted flyer and bon viveur,
who enjoyed this cameo appearences in Leni Reifenstahl
films, struggled with his desk job at the top level of the
leadership. Goring couldn't care less, however, and his
treatment of Uder was a particularly impressive example
of how capriciously he ran his ministry, where the con-
cept of administrative supervision was unheard of.

  When the Reich aviation minister and Goring talked
together, they liked to reminisce about the good old
days, when they had fought aerial battles together in
the First World War, high on cocaine.

  On the other hand they were less keen on talking about
current armament problems, the complex process of
developiong new types of aircraft and other similarly intri-
cate matters. At his opening speech at the ministry Uder
admitted, his face cloudy and terribly hungover, that it
would be unwise to expect him to perform many admin-
istrative duties. The only problem was that he was now
in charge of up to twenty-four different offices, which
were soon in a state of indescribable chaos. Udet, who
was known to serve cognac at meetings throughout the
day, and to take methamphetamine in enormous quantities
to balance out the effects of the alcohol, was notorious
for extraordinary mismanagemenet even within the ineffi-
cient Reich aviation ministry.

  Uder particularly liked to spend his days drawing cari-
catures, often enough of himself. Whenever possible, he
crept off home, where he ran a small private bar decorated
with trophies from his world travels, and always sur-
rounded himself with friends because he couldn't bear to
be alone. Although he just wanted to be sitting in a plane
stunt flying, there was no time for that now; Uder was
imploding under the burden of his constantly increasing
responsibilities. In the course of 1941 he shovelled Pervitin
into his mouth in dangerous quantities to keep himself
capable of functioning. In that way he personified the
hubris of German warfare, which had overstretched itself
and lost contact with reality long ago. "Our defeat was
caused by Uder," Hitler, of all people, would later claim.
"That man concocted the most nonsensical state of affairs
ever seen in the history of the Luftwaffe". And that was
saying something

There's other information in the book about Hitler's personal
drug addiction and having to get off wobbly trains so that he
could shoot up. But the methamphetamine use is the most interesting
part of this important book.

I read the book in June 2019 and have finally got around to reviewing
it.
