BRIDGE BURNING and other hobbies by Kitty Flanagan

2018. Allen & Unwin. Paperback.

This is a highly entertaining book by stand-up comedian Kitty
Flanagan. It's a collection of twenty-five vignettes from Flanagan's
own life told with a comedian's gift for exaggeration.

I read this book in record time. Close friend James Ponza is a huge
Flanagan fan and when I saw the book for $3 at Vinnies I naturally
bought it for him. Before gifting him this already second-hand book I
quickly read it myself. It took me about three hours reading time to
race through the 258 pages.

Flanagan is refreshingly honest about her childhood, early jobs and
standup and her dating mishaps. She's not a comedian who puts
other people down, and admits her own part in her relationship
breakups.

I'm sure James will enjoy this at-least third-hand book even more than
I did.
