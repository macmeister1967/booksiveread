GAME SET CASH by Brad Hutchins

Inside the secret world of International Tennis Trading

2014. Nero. Paperback.

I've found that many of the most entertaining books I've read have all
been on sports subjects and this rollicking book continues that
tradition. It's the true confessions of a court-sider; someone who
watches live tennis games and transmits the scores in real time where
they can be used by gamblers to place bets on a predetermined outcome.

The way Hutchins tells it, there isn't any point-by-point betting in
tennis (the way you can bet on the outcome of an individual ball in a
cricket match: Spot Betting) but the prices change significantly after
every point. A betting syndicate can get bets on (armed with the
knowledge of the outcome of a single point) and beat the market rise.

There's an army of a dozen or so courtsiders working for half a dozen
syndicates. The tennis authorities hire security to crack down on the
practice and Hutchins gets thrown out of Wimbledon for life; although
his scariest experiences are in India.

The drinking and partying in the book are what you'd expect of an
Aussie sports fan in his twenties, living the dream. It sounds like
the best two years of his life and he has trouble adjusting to a
mundane existence after his tennis courtsiding is over.
