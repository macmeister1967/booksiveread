KURT VONNEGUT: THE LAST INTERVIEW and OTHER CONVERSATIONS

2011. Melville House Publishing

This short book is a collection of six interviews with Kurt Vonnegut
from 1977 through to 2007. My favourite is a Playboy Interview with
both Vonnegut and Joseph Heller.

There's some repetition in the interviews, Vonnegut tells the
story of his family and his brother (inventor of a cloud-seeding
technique to increase chances of rainfall) and architect father.
Kurt was made to study Chemistry but wasn't good at it, the
Second World War intervening and writing short stories for magazines
allowing him to make a living and get a start in writing in the
post-War years.

There's a fair bit on Slaughterhouse-Five and Cat's Cradle in the book,
not much on any of Vonnegut's other works (I wished he'd had something
to say about his earliest success, Player Piano).  Vonnegut suggests that
he's the only person to have benefitted from the World War 2 firebombing
of Dresden. It didn't shorten the war or have a Military gain, but
Vonnegut's profits from Slaughterhouse-Five made him about $4 per
victim; and there were 110,000 of them.

In the late Interviews, Vonnegut says people are afraid of loneliness
and many people harbour a death wish and don't cope with life well.

I have a much bigger book of Vonnegut Interviews ("Conversations with
Vonnegut") that should be more varied; this book was still very interesting
and a very easy read.
