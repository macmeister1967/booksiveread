MOONRAKER by Ian Fleming

1950s. Pan. Paperback.

Packing up books in FLemington I couldn't resist a re-read of
Moonraker, and a rollicking quick read it was too; finishing the
whole book in a few reading sessions in less than 24 hours.

Moonraker is unique in the James Bond canon in being set
entirely within the UK. James Bond investigates a Bridge cheating
scandal at M's exclusive private club, and is then called on to
provide security for the cheater; a Richard-Branson like
industrialist hero who turns out to be a late-running Nazi who
isn't test-firing a rocket but intends to fire it straight
into London. James Bond saves the day.

The villain, Hugo Drax, is the first of the Bond villains to cheat
at Cards. Auric Goldfinger cheats at Canasta and in the movie
Octopussy Kamal Khan cheats at Backgammon. Cheating at games is
a sure sign that a Bond villain is a rotter.

By the time this got made into a movie the rocket scenario had dated
considerably and Roger Moore's Moonraker was a laser beam Space Shuttle
Space Opera, totally different from the 1950s book. The movie
before it, The Spy Who Loved Me, is also totally different from its
Ian Fleming namesake.

A final comment on the edition I read - it's a third-hand or
fourth-hand book with browning pages and black texta crosses over
the cover and the first few pages, but it's still a usable book and
still quite readable. A credit for a codex that's almost sixty years old.
I'll probably replace it when I see a newer, cleaner edition
cheaply in a second hand sale, but for now it functions as my copy of
Moonraker.
