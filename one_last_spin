ONE LAST SPIN by Drew Rooke.

The Power and Peril of the Pokies.

2018. Scribe. Paperback.

More than any book I've read, this book is dedicated to me.
It's inscribed "To all those in Australia who have been harmed by
poker machines."

Not a player myself, my closest brother Craig has played these
horrible machines, addictive by design, since his twenties. They've
cost him his money, his livelihood and his prospects.

Craig's not alone. Freelance journalist Drew Rooke talks to many other
addicts and shows the sad effects of poker machines on the
players. The gaming industry buys politicians to prevent meaningful
reform. Losses disguised as wins, $10 per three second maximum bets
and the first $5,000 of a win being paid out in cash are just three of
the current problems that need fixing.

Almost all of the industry people Rooke interviews have made their
peace with pokies and sleep very well at night. I was sad to learn of
the attitude of West Ashfield Club's chairman Mike Bailey, the
longtime ABC TV weatherman. I feel that people inside the bubble can't
see the harm their industry causes.

A court case from a gambler versus Crown Melbourne and Aristrocrat
fails, but there is hope for the future. The answer seems to be for
activists to follow the steps taken to delegitimise smoking. Some pubs
have moved to pokies-free and the nexus between clubs, poker machines
and community grants might slowly be broken.

But it's a long road ahead. New machines and challenges present
themselves constantly. Drew Rooke's excellent book is a lively summary
of the state of play in 2018, with some hope for the future.
