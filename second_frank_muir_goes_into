THE SECOND FRANK MUIR GOES INTO by Frank Muir and Simon Brett

1980. Star. Paperback.

This is a light-entertainment book and is the second of three books
from a Radio series. A collection of short jokes and linking commentary
from Frank Muir. It's very much in the style of The Frank Muir book
but a lot more lighthearted (the excerpts in the Frank Muir Book are
almost all sarcastic criticism; here things are a lot gentler and
more lighthearted).

There's a few excerpts from Ambrose Bierce's Devil's Dictionary and
some quotes from Dr Samuel Johnson, and lots of other sources. This is
a very quick read and brings some smiles and has no deeper purpose.
Some of the excerpts are from UK newspapers and reader letters and show
an affection for the ordinary Englishman.

The publisher, Star, are related to the paperback publishers of
my first big series of books as a child, the Doctor Who novalisations.
So I'm excited to read something a little more upmarket from a
related publisher.
