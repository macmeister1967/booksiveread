SHAM Self-Help and Actualization Movement by Steve Salerno

"How the gurus of the self-help movement make us helpless".

2006. Nicholas Brealey Publishing. Paperback.

This is an entire book by a journalist devoted to tearing down the
self-help gurus and motivational industry. The main targets are
Dr. Phil, Oprah, Anthony Robbins and John Gray. Motivational leaders
who run seminars and produce an endless stream of related books are
prime targets for Salerno's exposure.

As well as motivational Sham there is also recovery Sham, the most
famous group of which is Alcoholics Anonymous. Salerno suggests the
recovery rate for members is the same as that for people with no
involvment with the program.

Sham was a very entertaing read (in December 2021) and is preaching to
the converted to a scientifc sceptic like me. It will be worth a
re-read in coming years.
