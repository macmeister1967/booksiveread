STORY OF A SECRET STATE by Jan Karski

1944. (2001) Penguin Classics. Hardback

I bought this book solely because of the discount price ($5) and
the publisher, the great Penguin Classics and this one in Hardback.
Penguin normally publish their non-fiction hardbacks under the
AllenLane imprint but this one is called a Penguin Classic. Same book
either way, really.

I gave up on the book a few times during my reading and two-timed it
with easier reads along the way. But it was a book that was worth
returning to and rewarded me for reading it. Some of the material has
dated badly and the minutiae of Polish politics of the 1940s and the
party makeup of the Underground government is of no interest. But there's
some fantastic episodes of wartime underground derring-do. Karski
undergoes an early POW experience, a prisoner swap moving him from the
control of the Russians to the Germans, a daring train escape, capture
by the Germans during a border crossing and a Gestapo interrogation.
Karski survives a wrist-slashing suicide bid and is rescued from hospital
and then works on Undergroud newspapers and liasons; passing messages
between the different parts of the Underground. He's hugely proud of
the Poles and that there were no Quislings or collaborators with the
occupying Germans.

The Polish Underground made too many mistakes by expecting the war
to be short and expecting France and England to overwhelm the Germans
in a short time.

Karski witnessed first hand concentration-camp horrors; not the gas
chambers but sardine-packed death trains of Jews killed by quicklime.
Sent to England and then the United States to get the story to the
Allies, this 1944 book is his Report to the World.
