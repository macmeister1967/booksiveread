THE DARK NET by Jamie Bartlett

2015. Windmill Books. Paperback.

This book is an excellent survey of the darker side of the Internet
from a UK perspective. The organisation of the book is first rate
and each chapter covers a different aspect of the murky underground
online world. I found Chapters 1, 3 and 5 the most interesting.

Chapter 1: Unmasking the Trolls

Early online history; usenet, 4chan, doxxing

Chapter 2: The Lone Wolf

Political extremists on the Internet. Some of the people
(eg Tommy Robinson) I don't consider too extreme and have
political sympathy with.

Chapter 3: Into Galt's Gulch

Bitcoin and associated technologies. Libertarians.
Cryptography and Cypherpunks.

Chapter 4: Three Clicks.

Tor and hidden services and their use for underage pornography.

Chapter 5: On the Road.

The Silk Road and drug buying on the Internet. Digital reputation
and buyer rating schemes. Escrow.

Chapter 6: Lights, Web-camera, Action

Webcam sex performers

Chapter 7: The Werther Effect

Suicide support/encouragement groups on the internet.

Conclusion: Zoltan vs Zerzan

Artifical life after death. The Hive Mind.

Notes: 52 pages of notes; about one-sixth of the book.
