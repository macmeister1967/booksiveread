THE DROP by Michael Connelly

2011. Allen&Unwin. Paperback.

This is about the tenth Michael Connelly crime thriller I've read
and each one seems better than the last. In The Drop, Bosch
investigates a suicide which turns out to indeed be a suicide and
finally catches a serial killer and rapist from decades ago
from the Unsolved Crimes unit.

I first read Connelly in 2016 in hospital and this book came to hospital
with me in 2021 (the first operation was to fix my right knee
patella tendons, the second to take out a lump in my shoulder which
luckily turned out to be a benign lipoma). In both circumstances I was
too taken with painkillers and recovery to be able to do much reading and
had to finish the book at home afterwards.

Ian Fleming said that the job of a thriller writer was simply to hook
the reader and make him want to keep turning the pages; The Drop was
a page turner and it was pretty easy to read 40 or more pages each
sitting. The Drop was a very satisfying read.
