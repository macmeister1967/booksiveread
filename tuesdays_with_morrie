TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE by Mitch Albom

1997. Hodder headline. Paperback.

What really matters in life? We're all going to die in the end.
Maybe a dieing wise man can tell us what really matters.

Mitch Albom, a successful sportswriter, reconnects with his favourite
College professor Morrie Schwartz, who is dieing of an incurable disease
known by the name of a famous sportsman, Lou Gehrig's Disease.

The answers to what's important in life are what you'd expect: family,
love and your loved ones. This perfectly paced book made me cry and
made me think; without being at all patronising or exploitative.

You know at the beginning of the book that Morrie will die at the
end but his deterioration is captured well over the course of the
weekly Tuesdays that Albom spends with him. Interestingly, Morrie's
wife and Albom's wife aren't mentioned in the early weeks but become
more important towards the end.

I read this book in two days (it's an easy quick read) in the
Coronavirus panic and it seemed a good time to be reading it.
I believe it was a birthday present from my brother Grahame a few years
ago and my reading was one and two days after my 49th birthday.
Without trowelling it on, "Tuesdays with Morrie" is a wonderful
book about family love and the important things in life.

Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke met with a writer each Wednesday
towards the end of his life, the resulting book "Wednesdays with Bob"
looks to be based on this book's idea of spending regular time with
people towards the end of their lives and recording their wisdom.

Albom followed the success of "Morrie" with another best-selling
book, "The Five People You Meet in Heaven".
