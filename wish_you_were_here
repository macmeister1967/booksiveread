WISH YOU WERE HERE the Official Biography of Douglas Adams by Nick Webb

2003. headline book publishing. Paperback.

This is a fantastic biography of Douglas Adams, extremely sympathetic
to its subject. It's very well organised with session-length chapters
of 30-40 pages each and should probably be read in that way. I read it
as the last book in my house before moving back from Carlingford
to Flemington and it was a great single book to have around the house.

Adams's parents divorced early and he was the child of an extended family
from the age of five. His father had a taste for luxury above his station.
The book has a lot about Adam's early experience in comedy; in the
Cambridge Footlights and peripheral to the Pythons. The Hitchhiker's Guide
forms the major part of Adams's output and the book has extensive
coverage of that, and just a little bit about Adams's work with Doctor Who.
The late environmental book Last Chance to See was deeply important to
Adams and receives ample treatment in the book; together with the struggle
to get a movie version of Hitchhiker's made (not realised in Adams lifetime,
it came out about four years later in 2005).

Nick Webb is firmly of the view that Adams is a Polymath, an all-rounder
and one of the rare people who could bridge the gap between Hard Science
and Popular Art. This biography is unlikely to be bettered. The footnotes
in particular are excellent and there's a lot of good cultural information
on television, book publishing and UK life in the 1960s-2000s.
